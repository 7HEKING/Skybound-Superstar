# Skybound-Superstar
#### A Lua script for the [Stand Lua API](https://stand.gg/help/lua-api-documentation) that automatically aims, with the weaponized vehicle you are in, at other players within a specified field of view (FOV). 

#### It assesses variables such as the height above ground, line of sight, player distance and status to determine whether to engage the lock-on.
