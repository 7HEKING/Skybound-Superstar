A lua script for the [Stand lua API](https://stand.gg/help/lua-api-documentation) , that automatically aims at other players within a specified field of view (FOV) and within a certain distance. It also considers factors such as the height above ground, line of sight, and player status to determine whether to engage the lock-on.
